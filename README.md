## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks by building a CNN model from scratch. By implementing the various components of a CNN, including layers, neurons, and activation functions, we can delve into the inner workings of this powerful deep learning architecture.

## Features

Implementation of a CNN model from scratch
Customizable architecture with different layers, activation functions, and neuron configurations
Forward and backward propagation algorithms for training the model
Support for popular activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Thiagovasc/cnn-model-from-scratch.git

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd cnn-model-from-scratch

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To use the CNN model from scratch, follow these steps:

Import the necessary classes and functions:

    from models.cnn import CNN
    from models.layer import Layer
    from models.neuron import Neuron
    from utils.train_utils import ActivationFunctions
